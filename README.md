# Movie Recommendation System

### Description

Movie recommender that recommends movies with Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. This repository contains collaborative filtering implemented with both K Nearest Neighbours algorithm and matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition and content-based filtering. We also made a basic GUI for a small dataset using content-based filtering.




### Team & Roles

**Gizem Kurnaz** - Content based filtering & implementation of GUI

**Ayşe Ceren Çiçek** - Collaborative filtering with KNN and matrix factorization
